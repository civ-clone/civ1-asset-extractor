This isn't particularly clever at the moment, different versions of the game have more differences. I could look for
changes that jCivEd uses (for example), or do something a bit more programmatic (look for the blue separator lines).

I'm not sure how much this changes version to version, but it's something I could do with more data on.

I'd also like to integrate this with the renderer so that if the `assets/` directory doesn't exist, it can be launched
via the GUI to process the PIC files. This should be easy enough.
